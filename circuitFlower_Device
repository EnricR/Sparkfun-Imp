    The idea for this code was inspired by this gist by industrialinternet:
    https://gist.github.com/industrialinternet/5419730

    This example code demonstrates how an imp can publish information to a
    webpage. Pin 2 is configured as an input. It can be either
    digital or analog. 

    There are three parts to this code:
    1. The imp (device) code. The imp itself simply reads its pin values, and
        sends them out to the agent.
    2. The agent code. The agent waits for an http request. On such a request,
        it'll construct a JSON of the imp's pin values, and respond with that.
    3. An html page to make the http request and handle the response from the agent.
        There are a number of ways to do this. See one example at the bottom of
        The agent code.

///////////
// Setup //
///////////

// Register imp. This good practice: 
imp.configure("Imp Pin Web Response",[],[]);

// Configure pins:

hardware.pin2.configure(ANALOG_IN);

//////////////////////////
// Function Definitions //
//////////////////////////

// sendPins reads each of the pins, stores them in a table, and sends that 
// table out to the agent.
// It calls itself every 100ms -- 10 times a second.
function sendPins()
{
    // Read each of the pins and store them in a table.
    // The key names -- "pin1", "pin2", etc. -- should be kept the same, unless
    // you also change them in the device.on() function on the agent.
    local pinValues = 
    {
        pin2 = hardware.pin2.read(),
        voltage = hardware.voltage()    // We'll also send the operating voltage.
    }

    // Once the table is constructed, send it out to the agent with "impValues"
    // as the identifier.
    agent.send("impValues", pinValues);

    // Schedule a wakeup in 100ms, with a callback to this function.
    imp.wakeup(0.1, sendPins);
}

sendPins(); // Call sendPins once, and let it do the rest of the work.
